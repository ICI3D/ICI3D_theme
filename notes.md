this repo now contains all of the style and database files that drive other ici3d sites

## TODO

this repo should eventually have content-free content (web pages that we use to test features and formatting)

databases
* should we migrate some of our yaml data to csv/tsv?
* should we make rules to easily convert? Which one is best for _archiving_?
* where else do we have database-like info? should we curate all of it here?
	* Faikah is curating a fairly cool spreadsheet somewhere on Drive

Get it live! What's the best structure?
* keep current structure (gh-pages) for now
